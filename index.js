/*
  - goal: let users select options, then show price
  - handling the price:
    - we can store it in a variable
    - the price should change when an option is clicked
  - handling the options:
    - use checkboxes for options that can all be added 
    - use radio buttons where user can only select one
    - data can be stored in an object
  - handling the display:
    - we want to show a list of selections, not just price
